# WAGA Coffee Platform - TODO List

## **‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS**

### **1. Core System Implementation**
- [x] **Processor Integration**: Add PROCESSOR_ROLE and batch request functionality to smart contracts
- [x] **Code Cleanup**: Fix error naming conventions, remove duplicate functions, and update tests/scripts
- [x] **Test Reorganization**: Rename and organize test files for clarity
- [x] **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement selective transparency with proper data visibility controls
- [x] **ZK Privacy System**: Complete ZK proof verification and privacy configuration system

### **2. Smart Contract Features**
- [x] **Processor Role**: Added PROCESSOR_ROLE to WAGAConfigManager.sol
- [x] **Distributor Role**: Added DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE for price visibility control
- [x] **Batch Creation**: Updated createBatch() to accept both ADMIN_ROLE and PROCESSOR_ROLE
- [x] **Batch Requests**: Implemented requestBatch() function and tracking system
- [x] **Batch Request Access Control**: Only distributors can request batches (public users restricted) - **CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC FIX**

- [x] **Quality Privacy**: Quality data hidden but proven via ZK proofs
- [x] **Supply Chain Privacy**: Supply chain data hidden but proven via ZK proofs
- [x] **ZK Proof Verification**: Complete ZK proof verification system for privacy claims
- [x] **Selective Transparency**: Different data visibility based on user roles

### **4. Testing & Quality Assurance**
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive ZK integration testing
- [x] **Role-Based Testing**: Tests for different user access levels
- [x] **Batch Request Testing**: Tests for batch request functionality
- [x] **Chainlink Integration**: Tests for Chainlink verification workflows
- [x] **Backward Compatibility**: Tests for legacy function compatibility

## **üîÑ IN PROGRESS**

### **5. Documentation & Organization**
- [ ] **Documentation Organization**: Move all .md files to docs/ folder (except README.md and STATUS.md)

## **‚è≥ PENDING TASKS**

### **6. Payment Processing & Fees**
- [ ] **USDC Integration**: Implement USDC payment processing for token redemptions
- [ ] **Platform Fees**: Add fee structure for redemptions and verifications
- [ ] **Fee Distribution**: Implement fee distribution for staking rewards and Chainlink services

### **7. Frontend Updates**
- [ ] **Processor Portal**: Create frontend interface for processors to create batches
- [ ] **Distributor Portal**: Update distributor interface with price visibility
- [ ] **Public Portal**: Update public interface to hide sensitive data
- [ ] **ZK Proof Generation**: Implement real-time ZK proof generation in frontend
- [ ] **Role-Based UI**: Different UI components for different user types

### **8. Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Bulk Coffee Support**: Extend system to support green coffee and roasted coffee beans in bulk
- [ ] **Trade Finance Vault**: Implement USDC vault system for trade finance with coffee token collateral
- [ ] **Database Schema Update**: Update database schema from legacy system to support new user roles and ZK features

### **9. System Enhancements**
- [ ] **ZK Supply Proofs**: Implement ZK proofs to hide total token supply from everyone except holders
- [ ] **Advanced Privacy**: Implement more sophisticated privacy controls for competitive intelligence
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize gas usage and transaction efficiency
- [ ] **Security Audits**: Conduct comprehensive security audits of the ZK system

## **üìä Current System Status**

   - Public users: No price visibility, basic batch info only
   - Distributors: Price visibility, full batch info
   - Processors: Full access to create and manage batches
   - Admins: Complete system access

2. **ZK Privacy System**:
   - Price privacy with competitive positioning proofs
   - Quality tier privacy with verification proofs
   - Supply chain privacy with compliance proofs
   - Selective transparency based on user roles

3. **Batch Management**:
   - Processor batch creation with ZK privacy
   - Distributor batch requests
   - Admin verification and token minting
   - IPFS metadata management

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Comprehensive integration tests
   - Role-based access control tests
   - ZK proof verification tests
   - Chainlink integration tests

### **üéØ NEXT PRIORITIES**
1. **Documentation Organization**: Complete the docs/ folder structure
2. **Payment Processing**: Implement USDC integration and fee structure
3. **Frontend Updates**: Create role-based user interfaces
4. **Bulk Coffee Support**: Extend system for green coffee and bulk sales
