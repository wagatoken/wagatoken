# üîß Optimized WAGAInventoryManager ‚Äì Refactoring Summary

This document outlines key optimizations applied to the `WAGAInventoryManager` contract, enhancing gas efficiency, readability, and maintainability.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Changes

### 1. **Storage Optimization**
- Avoided redundant `SSTORE` calls by checking if values have changed before updating.
- Reduced writes to `lastBatchAuditTime`, `verificationRequests`.

### 2. **Gas-Efficient Looping**
- Cached `block.timestamp` and `batchIds.length` to avoid recomputation.
- Used `unchecked` math where safe inside loops to reduce gas overhead.

### 3. **Avoided Repeated Calls**
- Replaced repeated calls to `coffeeToken.batchInfo(batchId)` with a single destructuring.

### 4. **Enums Over Constants**
- Replaced `uint8` upkeep type constants with a `UpkeepType` enum for better readability and type safety.

### 5. **Custom Errors**
- Replaced string-based `require` messages with custom errors like `Unauthorized()` and `InvalidBatch()` to save gas.

### 6. **Array Efficiency**
- Avoided inline assembly by using temporary memory arrays and slicing only when necessary.

### 7. **Code Consolidation**
- Moved long logic functions (e.g. expiry, inventory, verification checks) to internal helpers.
- Recommended moving upkeep logic to a separate library for modular design (optional).

### 8. **Manual Verification Function Removed**
- `manuallyVerifyBatch()` was removed to reduce contract size and attack surface.

### 9. **Constants Grouping**
- Grouped related time-based thresholds into a single struct to minimize storage lookups and support batch updates.

## üîÅ Optional Enhancements

| Category | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Contract Size | Move `checkUpkeep`/`performUpkeep` logic into `WAGAUpkeepLib` |
| Data Management | Consider indexed mappings for fast batch lookup |
| Monitoring | Add more granular events with `indexed` parameters |
| Future Proofing | Add feature flag system for conditional checks |

## üìé Suggested Next Steps

- Run gas reports before and after to confirm savings.
- Test with fuzzing and mainnet fork simulations.
- Evaluate EIP-2535 (Diamond Standard) for large modularity in future versions.
